## Installation
To run the code, first clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/praj2408/Credit-Card-Default-Classification
```
Create a virtual environment
```
conda create -p venv python==3.8 -y
conda activate venv/
```

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run the `app.py` file to start the Flask web application:
```
python app.py
```

## Conclusion
In this project, we have explored and preprocessed the UCI Credit Card Defaulters Dataset, selected and tuned a machine learning model, and trained and evaluated the final model. The trained model can be used to predict whether a credit card holder will default on their payments or not.
